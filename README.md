# Ninja Builder Boilerplate (VueJS)

A starting point for building a "builder" interface in the "Ninja UI" using components.

### Example

This project includes a demo of the builder's implementation, using the existing Ninja Forms "Form Builder" as an example.

See `src/main.js` for the entry point of the example implementation.
